**The goal of this wiki is to provide an easy to navigate overview over the imaging facilities within CIR and provide shared tools and documentation for data collection procedures, experimental setups, data pre-processing and analysis. If you find this a useful resource, please support the effort by maintaining this wiki and sharing information and scripts that may be of use to colleagues.**

CIR is a joint venture of Karolinska University Hospital, Karolinska Institutet, and Region Stockholm, providing state-of-the-art imaging of all organs and systems in vivo, in humans and various animal models. The centre gathers a unique set of core facilities for structural, functional, and metabolic imaging, with a special focus on translational brain imaging. CIR serves academic, clinical, and industrial users with imaging facilities and services of the highest standard.
